#Instagallery

### Objective

The objective is to accept a hashtag, hit the Instagram API and display 10 photos in a gallery.

#### User Flow

1. User goes to `http://localhost:3000/` and a single page web app is rendered.
2. User enters a hashtag into the search box and clicks the "Search" button.
3. The app makes a call to `http://localhost:3000/hashtag/:hashtag` and retrieves JSON.
4. The JSON is rendered as a gallery.

#### App Layout

### Notes

* The frontend should be a single page app built using React or Angular.
* Feel free to use any other libraries/frameworks you want.
* All files in the `public` folder will be served up automatically. For example, if you create a new file at `public/css/app.css`, it will be available at `http://localhost:3000/css/app.css`.
* An Instagram API token has been provided in `app.js`.
